This is a website which my friend and me created in 2022 as a mini project for an event in our college called "Vihaan".

This is a simple website and HTML, CSS, JavaScript are used. 

Bootstrap for CSS is used.

Other than that, no other extensive frameworks are used here.

The website is static, so the website is not entirely functional.

Only the Python page and About Us page in the Homepage works. Also in Python page, Python Introduction in Basics of Python section and both tests in Tests section work.
